Only command points -> no tech level, no training
Camp-map-Logistics
Onle on field movement per turn (if not adding command points)


The ai plays based on realism. 


in battle: only Brigarden: fast-light attack; heavy-slow attack; defense


4 speeds
- slow: defense brigade (gesch端tze and artellerie, also soldiers on foot)
- very fast: jeeps
- fast: trucks, light-tanks
- normal slow: tanks, tank-transport 

Artellerei: trumps all
Gesch端tz: je nach tower: anti tank, all tanks, flak: soldiers and trucks/jeeps, granate launcher: light tank
AttackTanks: trumps all vehicles and gesch端tz.
light-tanks: trumps all trucs and jeeps and artellerie(not gesch端tz and tank)
Soldiers-sturm: trump light tanks with granates or anti tank gun
Anti tank gun also works against light-attack-tanks
Bazooka trumps all tanks, but soldiers are very soft
All systems trump soldiers.
